The aim of the EMF badge is to give people interesting hardware they've
probably not experimented with before while being simple enough that
anyone can play with it.

The
<a href="TiLDA_MKe" class="wikilink" title="TiLDA MKe project">TiLDA MKe
project</a> is code named "ElectroMagnetic Boogaloo"

The MKe is an entirely new design, based on the Arduino Due. It brings
an LCD display, Accelerometer and Gyro, along with a long-range wireless
transceiver. The original specification was to give people live schedule
updates and camp notifications, but the hardware was capable of much
more.

Please Note: There are a couple of minor hardware and some firmware
issues with the MKe that might be effecting your badge. If you've let
the magic smoke out of your charge controller or have tried to re-flash
and ended up with nothing but a couple of dimly glowing lights then DO
NOT DESPAIR -It's recoverable and fixes, documentation and lots of
firmware are still being produced :)

## EMW2013 - SiNE

the Neighbourhood of EMW</a>

Each attendee of Electromagnetic Wave received a SiNE badge, allowing
them to take part in a treasure hunt based around the boat. By solving
the clues, attendees were directed to an object or location either on or
near the Stubnitz. The clue letter was also the first letter of the
answer - large matching letters fitted with IR code transmitters were
stored at each location. Holding your badge in front of the letter lit
the corresponding light on a badge, allowing the user to collect them
all!
