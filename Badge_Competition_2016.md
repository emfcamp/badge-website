We're running a competition for the best use of the TiLDA Mk3 badge from
EMF 2016. We'll award a prize in two categories: software and hardware.

The prize in both categories will be **two tickets to EMF 2018** (plus
the 2017 one-day event if it happens), with the runners up getting
another TiLDA Mk3 badge.

## Entering

All apps [submitted to the app library](http://api.badge.emfcamp.org/)
will be considered for the competition. If your entry can't be uploaded
to the library, drop us an email at badge@emfcamp.org.

Entries will close on December 31st, 2016.
