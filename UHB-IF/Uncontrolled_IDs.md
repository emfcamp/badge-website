These VIDs were taken over by the hacker community without the
<a href="UHB-IF" class="wikilink" title="UHB-IF">UHB-IF</a>'s
permission. As they are in use, there is no way to enforce exclusivity
for them, and therefore the UHB-IF cannot assign them to anyone else.
They are self-managed by the community using them. Add your hexpansion
PID to the list to ensure nobody else uses the same identifiers. Please
add in numeric order to make searching easier.
