## Rules for apps in the official badge store

- App has to be "Rated G: General Audiences â€“ all ages admitted"
- App should not be of malicious nature
- App complies with EMF's [Code of
  Conduct](https://www.emfcamp.org/code-of-conduct)
- No code/image hot-loading without good reasons (since it might be
  change after the review process)
- It's fine for people to improve on Apps other have written. Likewise,
  if you submit an App, be aware that others can and will make changes
  to it.

## Packaging up your badge app for submission to the store

Every app becomes a new folder in the root of the Mk4-App GitHub
repository. So if you create a "snake" app, you need to put your program
files in a folder called "snake" with at least a "main.py" in it.

App names need to be unique (the folder structure enforces that). App
folders can contain multiple files (python and non python), but at a
minimum "main.py" with the correct headers is required.

Plesae verify that your apps folder structure is correct by running
"./tilda_tools validate" (this works without a badge) before submitting
it to the badge app store as the validations is also run by Travis to
check pull requests.

### Headers

main.py headers:

    ___title___         = "<your_app_name>"
    ___license___      = "MIT"
    ___dependencies___ = ["wifi", "http", "ugfx_helper", "sleep"]
    ___categories___   = ["<see below>"]
    ___bootstrapped___ = True # Whether or not apps get downloaded on first install. Defaults to "False", mostly likely you won't have to use this at all.

Please use one of these categories:

- System
- Homescreens
- Games
- Sound
- EMF
- Villages
- Phone
- LEDs
- Sensors
- Demo
- Other
