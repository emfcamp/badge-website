This page represents an effort to find out more about the inner workings
of the SIM800 module found on the TiLDA MK4 badge.

Feel free to add your own research, but please do not remove content
added by other people, even if you determined the information to be

## Current state of research

Based on the flashing utility and firmware file provided on the raviyp
website the SIM800 module probably contains a Mediatek dumb-phone
chipset. Bunny did some research on those already, which can be found on
his [1](https://www.bunniestudios.com/blog/?p=4297%7Cblog).

## To-do list

`- Removing the lid from a SIM800 module and taking photos of the insides`
`- Figuring out exactly which (Mediatek) chip is inside the SIM800`
`- Find a way to replace the built-in ringtones`
`- ???`
`- Profit!`
