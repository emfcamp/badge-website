Should your badge stop working there are these ways to fix it. Please
make sure you have a backup of whatever you've been working on, you
might lose all the data stored on your badge.

Todo: Is there an easier way?

## Factory reset the badge

Press and hold 'MENU' and then briefly press the reset button on the
back. Keep the MENU button held down, then release it when both the
green and red LED are on at the same time. Both LEDs should flash for a
few times. Wait a few seconds until the blinking has stopped and press
reset again.

After that you should finally get a screen saying "Downloading TiLDA
software". It should take less than a minute until the badge
functionalities are restored, but you will have to re-install your apps.

P.S. The micropython documentation on factory resetting is
[here](http://docs.micropython.org/en/latest/pyboard/pyboard/tutorial/reset.html).
On the TiLDA MK3 the USR button is the MENU button, and the orange LED
is actually red.
