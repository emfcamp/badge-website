The Unnecessary Hexpansion Bureaucracy Implementers Forum (UHB-IF)
exists to implement unnecessary hexpansion bureaucracy.

The only way to obtain a Vendor ID to use with hexpansion EEPROMs is via
the UHB-IF. You will need a vendor ID to make a valid hexpansion EEPROM
header. UHB-IF makes sure that Vendor IDs used by hexpansions are
inconvenient to obtain. To obtain a Vendor ID, fill out the right UHB-IF
form. Forms are available from authorized representatives of the UHB-IF.
The authorized representative at EMF2024 is the
[Consulate](https://wiki.emfcamp.org/2024/wiki/ScottishConsulate%7CScottish).
To request the right form from the Scottish Consulate, please fill in
[form
REQ1](https://usercontent.irccloud-cdn.com/file/A6xrTR6Z/Consulate%20Scot%20REQ1.pdf)
and present it in person to the Scottish Consulate during their posted
hours of operation. Some copies of REQ1 might be available at the badge
team and/or Scottish Consulate. For further information about how the
Scottish Consulate handles procedures can be found in
\[<https://scottishconsulate.org/right_link>\| their wiki\].

Organizations wishing to use the legacy REQ-9 method of application
should contact the authorized representative for further instructions.

In defiance of the UHB-IF, rebel hackers have homesteaded on some vendor
IDs. They are linked below:

The UHB-IF does not approve of unbureaucratic mechanisms like this, but
is powerless to do anything about them.
